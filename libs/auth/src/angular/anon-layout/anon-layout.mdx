# AnonLayout Component

The Auth-owned AnonLayoutComponent is to be used for unauthenticated pages, where we don't know who
the user is (this includes viewing a Send).

---

### Incorrect Usage ❌

The AnonLayoutComponent is **not** to be implemented by every component that uses it in that
component's template directly. For example, if you have a component template called
`example.component.html`, and you want it to use the AnonLayoutComponent, you will **not** be
writing:

```html
<!-- File: example.component.html -->

<auth-anon-layout>
  <div>Example component content</div>
</auth-anon-layout>
```

### Correct Usage ✅

Instead the AnonLayoutComponent is implemented solely in the router via routable composition, which
gives us the advantages of nested routes in Angular.

To allow for routable composition, Auth will also provide a wrapper component in each client, called
AnonLayout**Wrapper**Component.

For clarity:

- AnonLayoutComponent = the Auth-owned library component - `<auth-anon-layout>`
- AnonLayout**Wrapper**Component = the client-specific wrapper component to be used in a client
  routing module

The AnonLayout**Wrapper**Component embeds the AnonLayoutComponent along with the router outlets:

```html
<!-- File: anon-layout-wrapper.component.html -->

<auth-anon-layout>
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
  <router-outlet slot="secondary" name="secondary"></router-outlet>
</auth-anon-layout>
```

To implement, the developer does not need to work with the base AnonLayoutComponent directly. The
devoloper simply uses the AnonLayout**Wrapper**Component in `oss-routing.module.ts` (for Web, for
example) to construct the page via routable composition:

```javascript
// File: oss-routing.module.ts

{
    path: "",
    component: AnonLayoutWrapperComponent, // Wrapper component
    children: [
      {
        path: "sample-route", // replace with your route
        children: [
          {
            path: "",
            component: MyPrimaryComponent, // replace with your component
          },
          {
            path: "",
            component: MySecondaryComponent, // replace with your component (or remove this secondary outlet object entirely if not needed)
            outlet: "secondary",
          },
        ],
        data: {
          pageTitle: "logIn", // example of a translation key from messages.json
          pageSubtitle: "loginWithMasterPassword", // example of a translation key from messages.json
          pageIcon: LockIcon, // example of an icon to pass in
        },
      },
    ],
  },
```

And if the AnonLayout**Wrapper**Component is already being used in your client's routing module,
then your work will be as simple as just adding another child route under the `children` array.

### Data Properties

In the `oss-routing.module.ts` example above, notice the data properties being passed in:

- For the `pageTitle` and `pageSubtitle` - pass in a translation key from `messages.json`.
- For the `pageIcon` - import an icon (of type `Icon`) into the router file and use the icon
  directly.

All 3 of these properties are optional.

```javascript
import { LockIcon } from "@bitwarden/auth/angular";

// ...

{
  // ...
  data: {
    pageTitle: "logIn",
    pageSubtitle: "loginWithMasterPassword",
    pageIcon: LockIcon,
  },
}
```
